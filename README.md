Karad is a city in Satara district in the southern part of Indian state of Maharashtra and it is 320 km (180.19 miles) from Mumbai and 159 km from Pune. It lies at the confluence of Koyna River and the Krishna River known as the "Priti sangam". The two rivers originate at Mahabaleshwar (famous hill station in Satara- Maharashtra), which is around 100 km from Karad. They diverge at their origin, and travel for about the same distance to meet again in Karad.
